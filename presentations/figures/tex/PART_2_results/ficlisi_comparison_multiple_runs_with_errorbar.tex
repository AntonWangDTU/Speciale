    \caption{Mean cLISI scores (± standard deviation) across 10 runs for four embedding methods and four datasets. 
    PCA consistently outperforms VAE-based methods across all datasets. 
    Error bars represent variability across independent training runs. 
    Dataset-specific hyperparameters (latent dimension and denoising steps) were optimized via grid search.}
