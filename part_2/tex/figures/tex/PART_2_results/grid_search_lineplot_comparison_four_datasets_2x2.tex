    \caption{Grid search results comparing cLISI scores across latent dimensions and denoising steps for four datasets. 
    Each subplot shows cLISI scores as a function of denoising steps (x-axis) for multiple VAE latent dimensions (colored lines). 
    Point at denoising step 0 represents the baseline VAE embedding (no denoising), while subsequent points show progressive denoising refinement. 
    Horizontal dashed gray line shows best PCA score with corresponding dimensionality, 
    black dashed line shows raw HVG baseline. 
    \textbf{Top row:} allCT\_1.0k (left) and group\_5\_subset\_76 (right). 
    \textbf{Bottom row:} GSE114412\_cluster (left) and GSE114412\_subcluster (right). 
    All subplots share the same y-axis scale (0.75--1.0) for direct comparison. 
    PCA consistently outperforms VAE-based methods across all datasets and hyperparameter configurations. 
    Denoising shows minimal improvement over baseline VAE embeddings, with most trajectories remaining flat or showing marginal changes across denoising steps.}
